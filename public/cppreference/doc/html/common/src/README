This directory contains custom components of the MediaWiki installation
that was used to generate the cppreference documentation.

skins/ directory contains the MediaWiki skins that are used on
cppreference.com. The common/ directory is the standard stuff that comes
with MediaWiki and included only as a requirement of DFSG, the rest
is cppreference.com-specific.

The MediaWiki:* files have the contents of corresponding configuration
files in the messages namespace. You need the Gadgets extension to use them.
